works only js code, openssl commands do not work -> will try use correct localhost-domain and include passphrase in js*/





// this is used for ssl generation -> https://www.samltool.com/self_signed_certs.php

// use for combine key and cert into .pfx
// openssl pkcs12 -export -out ph-certandkey.pfx -inkey ph-key.txt -in ph-cert.txt

// this command extracts key from .pfx
// openssl pkcs12 -in ph-certandkey.pfx -nocerts -out extracted-ph-key.txt -nodes

// this command extracts cert from .pfx
// openssl pkcs12 -in ph-certandkey.pfx -clcerts -nokeys -out extracted-ph-cert.txt

// IMPORTANT! -> Postman [uses .pfx only] OR [need both CRT and KEY]
